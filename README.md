# VirtualDesktop-AHK

### Intention
 - We want to use these guys below to facilitate XFCE/Linux-like virtual desktop hotkeys (Alt + 1, Alt + 2, etc...) under Windows
     - https://www.autohotkey.com/
     - https://github.com/MScholtes/VirtualDesktop
 - My initial attempts had some usage nuances around reliable AutoHotkey usage, such as:
     - Loss of focus on a previously focused window from a previous virtual desktop
     - Reliability issues when switching between desktops quickly, related to `Send` usage
 - The current script has been tested under Windows 11 (10 & 7 may be okay, untested but let me know if you try)

Feel free to open an issue if you see obvious issues in the provided script.
